# JLPT Data Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview

The **Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)** is a standardized test designed to evaluate and certify the Japanese language proficiency of non-native speakers. It is an important tool for assessing Japanese language skills across various levels, ranging from the easiest (N5) to the most advanced (N1). This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of JLPT data, which helps to understand trends, forecast future performance, and evaluate the effectiveness of the test.

## Objectives

This analysis aims to:
- **Examine trends** in the number of JLPT applicants and examinees from 2009 to 2023.
- **Forecast future trends** in JLPT participation and performance.
- **Analyze performance** based on scores and passing rates by level and location (Japan and overseas).
- **Provide insights** into how the JLPT's reach and difficulty have evolved over the years.

## Data Sources

The data for this analysis has been gathered from:
- **The official JLPT website**, which provides historical data on applicants, examinees, and passing rates.
- **Additional data sources** from relevant Japanese language testing organizations and public datasets.
